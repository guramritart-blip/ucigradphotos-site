      <h2>A UCI Alum Who Knows Every Corner of Campus</h2>
      <p>As a proud UC Irvine graduate, I have spent nearly seven years photographing fellow Anteaters on the campus I know and love. From the shaded paths of Aldrich Park to the modern lines of the Engineering Gateway, I have captured hundreds of graduates in the spots that make UCI special. That familiarity means your session runs smoothly, with no wasted time figuring out where to go next.</p>
      <p>With professional off-camera lighting and a relaxed shooting style, every session feels natural and fun. You will not be stiffly posed in front of a building. Instead, you will move through campus hitting the best light at the best locations while I capture candid moments alongside polished portraits. The result is a gallery that feels like you, not a cookie-cutter template.</p>
      <p>I deliver all raw, unedited photos within 24 hours so you can start sharing your celebration right away. Fully edited images follow within 7 to 10 days. Whether you are graduating from the School of Engineering, Biological Sciences, Social Sciences, or any other program, your UCI graduation photos will reflect the hard work and joy of this milestone.</p>

      <h2>Best Photo Spots at UCI</h2>
      <p style="margin-bottom: var(--space-2xl);">UC Irvine offers a wide variety of scenic backdrops for graduation portraits. Here are six of the most popular locations I recommend for your session.</p>
      <div class="spots-grid">
        <div class="spot-card">
          <img src="images/portfolio/img-010.jpg" alt="Graduation photo at Aldrich Park UCI" loading="lazy">
          <h3>Aldrich Park</h3>
          <p>The heart of campus. Towering trees, lush greenery, and dappled sunlight make Aldrich Park the most iconic UCI photo location. The winding paths create depth in every frame, and the natural shade keeps the light soft even on bright days.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="spot-card">
          <img src="images/portfolio/img-018.jpg" alt="UCI Engineering Gateway graduation portrait" loading="lazy">
          <h3>Engineering Gateway</h3>
          <p>The fountain and modern architecture of the Engineering Gateway provide a clean, contemporary backdrop. This spot is especially popular with STEM graduates who want to celebrate their achievement right outside the building where they spent countless hours studying.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="spot-card">
          <img src="images/portfolio/img-025.jpg" alt="Langson Library UCI graduation photo" loading="lazy">
          <h3>Langson Library</h3>
          <p>With its striking exterior and grand columns, Langson Library gives your photos a classic, timeless feel. The steps leading up to the entrance create natural leading lines that draw the eye directly to you in your cap and gown.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="spot-card">
          <img src="images/portfolio/img-033.jpg" alt="Humanities Gateway UCI grad photos" loading="lazy">
          <h3>Humanities Gateway</h3>
          <p>The Humanities Gateway building offers textured walls and covered walkways that provide beautiful, even light. It is a less crowded alternative to Aldrich Park, making it perfect for graduates who want a quieter, more intimate setting for their portraits.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="spot-card">
          <img src="images/portfolio/img-042.jpg" alt="Ring Road UCI graduation photography" loading="lazy">
          <h3>Ring Road</h3>
          <p>The circular pathway that connects the entire campus is lined with trees and open spaces. Ring Road is ideal for walking shots, candid moments, and group photos. Its varied scenery means every few steps offer a new backdrop.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="spot-card">
          <img src="images/portfolio/img-055.jpg" alt="Peter the Anteater statue graduation photo" loading="lazy">
          <h3>Peter the Anteater</h3>
          <p>No UCI graduation photo session is complete without a shot with Peter the Anteater. The bronze mascot statue near the Student Center is a beloved campus landmark that instantly tells the world where you earned your degree.</p>
