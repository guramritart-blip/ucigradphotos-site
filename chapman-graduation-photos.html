      <h2>Chapman Graduation Photos in the Heart of Orange</h2>
      <p>Chapman University occupies one of the most picturesque campuses in Orange County. Nestled in the historic city of Orange, the campus blends classic Southern California architecture with lush landscaping and intimate courtyards that feel worlds apart from the surrounding streets. I have photographed Chapman graduates across every season and know exactly how to use the campus and its surroundings to create a diverse, visually rich gallery in a single session.</p>
      <p>What sets Chapman apart as a graduation photo destination is its proximity to Old Towne Orange. Within a short walk from campus, you can be posing in front of charming antique storefronts, under the shade of century-old trees, or in the iconic Orange Circle plaza. I regularly combine on-campus and off-campus locations in the same session, giving you a mix of collegiate and lifestyle backdrops that feel polished and personal at the same time.</p>
      <p>Every Chapman session includes professional off-camera lighting. This is not the harsh, flat flash you might picture. It is carefully positioned lighting that adds depth, dimension, and a cinematic quality to your portraits. Combined with my natural posing direction and relaxed shooting style, the result is a set of graduation photos that look editorial without feeling stiff or staged. All raw photos are delivered within 24 hours of your session, and fully edited images follow in 7 to 10 days.</p>

      <p class="section-label">Campus Locations</p>
      <h2>Best Photo Spots at Chapman</h2>
      <p style="margin-bottom: var(--space-2xl);">Chapman University and its surroundings offer a wonderful variety of graduation photo locations. Here are the four spots I recommend most.</p>
      <div class="spots-grid">
        <div class="spot-card">
          <img src="images/portfolio/img-010.jpg" alt="Memorial Hall Chapman University graduation photo" loading="lazy">
          <h3>Memorial Hall</h3>
          <p>Memorial Hall is the architectural centerpiece of Chapman University. The stately brick building with its white columns and grand entrance creates a classic, timeless look in graduation photos. The steps leading up to the front doors provide natural posing positions, and the symmetry of the facade makes for beautifully balanced compositions. This is the most requested Chapman photo spot for good reason.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="spot-card">
          <img src="images/portfolio/img-018.jpg" alt="Attallah Piazza Chapman University graduation portrait" loading="lazy">
          <h3>Attallah Piazza</h3>
          <p>The Attallah Piazza is an open courtyard area that serves as one of the main gathering spaces on campus. Surrounded by buildings with warm, Mediterranean-inspired architecture, the piazza offers a bright, airy setting for graduation portraits. The open sky and clean sightlines make it an excellent spot for off-camera lighting setups, and the warm tones of the surrounding structures complement cap-and-gown colors perfectly.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="spot-card">
          <img src="images/portfolio/img-025.jpg" alt="Hashinger Science Center Chapman graduation photos" loading="lazy">
          <h3>Hashinger Science Center</h3>
          <p>The Hashinger Science Center and its surrounding area offer a more modern aesthetic compared to the traditional look of Memorial Hall. The clean lines and contemporary design of the building work well for graduates who want a fresh, current feel in their photos. The nearby walkways and landscaped areas provide additional variety and make it easy to capture several different looks in a short amount of time.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="spot-card">
          <img src="images/portfolio/img-033.jpg" alt="Old Towne Orange graduation photography near Chapman" loading="lazy">
          <h3>Old Towne Orange</h3>
          <p>Just steps from campus, Old Towne Orange is a National Register Historic District filled with antique shops, charming storefronts, and tree-lined streets. The Orange Circle plaza at the center of town is a beloved photo spot with its iconic fountain and surrounding architecture. Combining campus and Old Towne locations in your session gives you a rich variety of backgrounds that feel distinctly Chapman.</p>
