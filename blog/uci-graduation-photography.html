      <h2>Extended Guide</h2>

      <p>Hello there! <strong>Congratulations! You've done it! YES YOU!</strong> I feel like the last question to ask you is "Soooo how was it?" Trust me I totally get it, getting through college is definitely not a vibe, but hey seems worth it now doesn't it?</p>

      <p>Anyway, now you're done and it is time to take some <strong>Graduation Photos</strong>. You're probably like I really do not want to stress about this too, so here is this blog to help you. This blog is definitely focused on <a href="../uci-graduation-photos.html" style="color:var(--accent);">Graduation Photography at UCI</a> (University of California, Irvine), and I will walk you through how I approach and shoot a Graduation Shoot at UC Irvine. If you want general tips on preparing for your session, check out our <a href="graduation-shoot-guide.html" style="color:var(--accent);">graduation photoshoot prep guide</a>.</p>

      <h3>How do I choose the right photographer</h3>

      <p>Here are a few things to consider while booking/looking for a photographer:</p>

      <p>Lets start from the beginning, where do I find a photographer in the first place? The UC Irvine Class of 20___ is a group page on Facebook which usually has over 10,000 people each year, on this site photographers usually will advertise their services. Instagram again a very reliable source with ease of communication as well a great way for photographers to showcase their Portfolio.</p>

      <p><strong>Availability:</strong> The months of April-July are hot for the photography industry, most photographers even take bookings in advanced, so if theres a photographer you like make sure to reach out them as early as you can.</p>

      <p><strong>Affordability:</strong> After 4 years, you do not want another bank breaking service, entry level graduation photographers are priced around 100 or below, but i find an experienced, professional price around the 300 and above mark.</p>

      <p><strong>Style:</strong> this brings me to the choice of photographer. To be honest, for most things in the world you will always find someone to provide a service for cheaper, its just the way the world works. For photography consider the following things, Quality of images and deliverables, Return time and volume. What I mean by this is, would you want your images to be taken in the style of the photographer, is the style something you resonate and is it something professional and worth.</p>

      <h2>UC Irvine Graduation Shoot Breakdown</h2>

      <p>Alright, now you know who or how to choose a photographer for your shoot. Now let me walk you through how I conduct a graduation shoot at UC Irvine.</p>

      <p>Say you've booked with me and we have set up a time and date, we first meet in front of <strong>Langson Library</strong> to warm up:</p>

      <p>The warm up session is time to break the ice, make you feel comfortable and practice the poses we will be doing throughout the shoot and talk about how and where we are going for the next 90 minutes or so.</p>

      <div class="img-slider">
        <div class="img-slider-track">
          <img src="../images/blog-uci-graduation-photography/0S9A2753.jpg" alt="UCI graduate posing in front of Langson Library" loading="lazy">
          <img src="../images/blog-uci-graduation-photography/IMG_9417.jpg" alt="UCI graduate holding sash at Langson Library" loading="lazy">

        </div>
      </div>

      <p>After we've warmed up and gotten a little comfortable we move over to the iconic <strong>Red flower area.</strong> Fun fact, the flower itself is white the leaves of the flower are the ones that are red and look pretty. The flower area has 4 areas we cover and here is what I call them:</p>

      <p>Cozy Corner, The poster image, The red backdrop and The Rabbit hole, dont ask me why all these just make sense in my head.</p>

      <div class="img-slider">
        <div class="img-slider-track">
          <img src="../images/blog-uci-graduation-photography/IMG_4489.jpg" alt="UCI graduate at Aldrich Park red flower cozy corner" loading="lazy">
          <img src="../images/blog-uci-graduation-photography/0S9A0280.jpg" alt="UCI graduate portrait in red flower area" loading="lazy">
          <img src="../images/blog-uci-graduation-photography/0S9A6001.jpg" alt="UCI graduate among red flowers in Aldrich Park" loading="lazy">
          <img src="../images/blog-uci-graduation-photography/0S9A1742.jpg" alt="UCI graduate with red flower backdrop" loading="lazy">
          <img src="../images/blog-uci-graduation-photography/0S9A2594.jpg" alt="UCI graduate editorial portrait in red flowers" loading="lazy">
          <img src="../images/blog-uci-graduation-photography/0S9A1707.jpg" alt="UCI graduate posing in Aldrich Park red flower area" loading="lazy">
          <img src="../images/blog-uci-graduation-photography/0S9A2104.jpg" alt="UCI graduate portrait with red flowers" loading="lazy">
          <img src="../images/blog-uci-graduation-photography/0S9A2736.jpg" alt="UCI graduate in cap and gown at red flower area" loading="lazy">
          <img src="../images/blog-uci-graduation-photography/IMG_9575.jpg" alt="UCI graduate amidst red flowers Aldrich Park" loading="lazy">
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>This covers editorial style photos, gives you the whole park in the background and with the Lighting I use I am able to capture beautiful portraits amidst the red flowers in Aldrich Park.</p>

      <p>After this I make a quick stop right in front of the red flowers in Aldrich Park.</p>

      <div class="img-slider">
        <div class="img-slider-track">
          <img src="../images/blog-uci-graduation-photography/3E8A0850.jpg" alt="UCI graduate standing in front of red flowers" loading="lazy">
          <img src="../images/blog-uci-graduation-photography/IMG_2196.jpg" alt="UCI graduate with red flowers direct shot" loading="lazy">
          <img src="../images/blog-uci-graduation-photography/0S9A9139.jpg" alt="UCI graduate portrait with Aldrich Park flowers" loading="lazy">

          <img src="../images/blog-uci-graduation-photography/0S9A0445.jpg" alt="UCI graduate posing with Aldrich Park flowers" loading="lazy">
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>Next we move on to the iconic <strong>Big Tree at Aldrich Park</strong>, you know exactly the one I am Talking about. Here is where I have a little studio setting going on because of the tree, we take both studio styled and fun casual photos:</p>

      <div class="img-slider">
        <div class="img-slider-track">
          <img src="../images/blog-uci-graduation-photography/0S9A2134.jpg" alt="UCI graduate studio-style portrait at big tree in Aldrich Park" loading="lazy">
          <img src="../images/blog-uci-graduation-photography/0S9A2464.jpg" alt="UCI graduate casual portrait at Aldrich Park big tree" loading="lazy">
          <img src="../images/blog-uci-graduation-photography/IMG_5747.jpg" alt="UCI graduate fun portrait at the big tree" loading="lazy">
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>Lets keep moving, we then go to this one bench around the halfway point in Aldrich park (great spot for your extra stoles, you show off) toward the infinity fountain and we then proceed to the infinity fountain.</p>

      <div class="img-slider">
        <div class="img-slider-track">
          <img src="../images/blog-uci-graduation-photography/0S9A3174.jpg" alt="UCI graduate sitting on bench in Aldrich Park" loading="lazy">
          <img src="../images/blog-uci-graduation-photography/3E8A9362.jpg" alt="UCI graduate at Aldrich Park bench with stoles" loading="lazy">
          <img src="../images/blog-uci-graduation-photography/0S9A6427.jpg" alt="UCI graduate walking toward infinity fountain" loading="lazy">
          <img src="../images/blog-uci-graduation-photography/0S9A4444.jpg" alt="UCI graduate at infinity fountain" loading="lazy">
          <img src="../images/blog-uci-graduation-photography/IMG_4782.jpg" alt="UCI graduate portrait at infinity fountain area" loading="lazy">
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>This brings me to the end of my set route, Now after this you takeover we can visit your graduating school: <strong>Henry Samueli School of Engineering, Donald Bren ICS, Biology, Social Sciences, Humanities, Arts, Paul Merage etc</strong> as well as we can visit Peter either at <strong>Student Center</strong> or the <strong>Bren Events Center.</strong></p>

      <p>Last but not the least we have <strong>MSTB and the Bridge at Humanities.</strong> Usually the last stop since its far so we usually drive there but here it is: (Also a popular spot for your Champagne Popping photos)</p>
