      </div>
      <p>The University of Southern California is one of the most photographed campuses in the country, and for good reason. From the Romanesque columns of Doheny Memorial Library to the bronze glow of Tommy Trojan at golden hour, USC offers backdrops that are both grand and deeply personal. I have photographed dozens of Trojan graduates across every corner of the campus, and I know how to use those iconic settings to create portraits that stand out.</p>
      <p>Every USC session starts with a plan. Before your shoot day, I will discuss your preferred locations, the number of outfit changes, and any group shots you would like to include. On the day of, I arrive with professional off-camera lighting equipment that gives your photos a polished, editorial quality you simply cannot achieve with natural light alone.</p>
      <p>Whether you are finishing your undergraduate degree, completing your MBA at Marshall, or defending your dissertation, your USC graduation marks years of dedication. My goal is to match that energy with photos that feel as significant as the achievement itself. All raw, unedited photos are sent within 24 hours. Edited and retouched images follow in 7 to 10 days.</p>

          <p>"LOVED working with G! I'm so glad I decided to go with him when I took my grad photos. He let me keep ALL of the photos and was open to any places or ideas that I wanted to do. I had two culture outfits that I had to do and felt bad because it would take more time, but G reassured me that it was okay. I never felt rushed which was one thing I get nervous about when choosing photographers. Also, I was able to get the pictures back quickly which I was appreciative of."</p>

            <p>Yes. I am based in Irvine but regularly travel to the USC campus in Los Angeles for graduation sessions. The travel is built into my USC pricing so there are no extra fees.</p>

          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>I recommend booking at least 2 to 3 weeks before your preferred date, especially during graduation season in May and June. Early booking ensures you get your top choice of date and time slot.</p>
