        <div class="about-photos" style="grid-template-columns:1fr; max-width:300px;">
          <img src="images/about-recent.jpg" alt="G, UCI graduation photographer">
        </div>
        <p>My name is Guramrit Malhotra, or just to keep it simple, "G". I have been photographing graduates since 2019 and very much enjoy it more each year. I myself am an alumni from UCI (class of 2021, but hey, finished in 2023, shoutout COVID) which kind of makes sense?? UCI is the very place where my business as well as creative pathway began.</p>
        <p>I moved to the states for my undergrad in 2017 but life had different plans and now I get to do what I never thought I would be able to, and will not trade places with nobody.</p>
        <p>I also do wedding photography and am currently working on opening my own studio, which has been fun and interesting. If you'd like to check out my wedding work as well, here is the website: <a href="https://www.bokehweddings.com" target="_blank" style="color:var(--accent); text-decoration:underline;">bokehweddings.com</a></p>
        <p>Being a photographer and filmmaker is a huge part of who I am but I also enjoy just meeting new people. Every grad has their own fair share of traumas haha, and I like to curate the photoshoot as a bit of a hangout and have some conversations of substance (cmon, it's like 2 hours, how much small talk will we do?). But hey, if you have booked with me or are deciding to, congratulations! It's no easy task to graduate but you did it. You should be proud :,)</p>
        <p style="color:var(--text-muted);">Also, here is me as a grad. Cheers!</p>

          <p>"Had an amazing experience working with G as my grad photographer! The photos turned out absolutely stunning, and I couldn't be happier with the results. G knew all the right poses and made the entire process feel natural and comfortable. He has the perfect balance between being professional and chill, which made the session really enjoyable. Highly recommend G for anyone looking for high-quality photos and a great experience."</p>

          <p>"LOVED working with G! I'm so glad I decided to go with him when I took my grad photos. He let me keep ALL of the photos and was open to any places or ideas that I wanted to do. I had two culture outfits that I had to do and felt bad because it would take more time, but G reassured me that it was okay. I never felt rushed which was one thing I get nervous about when choosing photographers. Also, I was able to get the pictures back quickly which I was appreciative of."</p>
